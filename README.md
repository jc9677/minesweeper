# React Minesweeper

This is a React-based version of the classic Minesweeper game. The game state is stored in local storage, so it persists across sessions. The user can choose the size of the game grid by specifying the number of rows and columns.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/githubnext/workspace-blank.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd workspace-blank
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Enter the desired number of rows and columns for the game grid.
3. Click "Start Game" to generate the Minesweeper grid.
4. Click on cells to reveal them. Right-click on cells to flag them as mines.
5. The game state will be saved in local storage, so you can continue your game even after closing the browser.
